== Summary

This project reimplements the Doom game objects as Entity-Component-System
entities and reworks DoomEdNums to refer to a list of entity "templates".
It uses the Rust programming language to achieve this in an efficient, but
flexible and reasonable, manner.

This implementation is tailored to PRBoom{plus}, and requires a fork/branch of
the PRBoom{plus} UMAPINFO fork. It serves as an experiment; do not expect the
result to be seamlessly playable, let alone demo compatible!

== Roadmap

* [x] Write wrapper header to use PRBoom+ code from Rust.
* [x] Setup bindgen.
* [ ] Setup PRBoom+ build system for linking the component's static library.
* Write systems that interface with PRBoom+ components:
* * [ ] Position and velocity.
* * [ ] Collision and thing interaction.
* *  [ ] Health and armour.
* * [ ] Rendering.
* * [ ] Audio.
* * [ ] Projectiles and general entity spawning.
* Set up unit testing.
* * [ ] Setup a test environment to be used when testing a System.
* * [ ] Write unit tests for each system, preferably more than one per system.
* [ ] Write entity templates based on DoomEdNums.
* [ ] Rewrite core PRBoom+ functions to use our new component.
